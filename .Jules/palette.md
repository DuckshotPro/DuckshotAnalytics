## 2026-01-02 - Accessible Skip Link & Decorative SVGs
**Learning:** Added a skip-to-content link, a critical yet often overlooked a11y feature. It is hidden until focused, respecting the design while empowering keyboard users. Also marked purely decorative SVGs with `aria-hidden="true"` to reduce screen reader noise.
**Action:** Always check for a main content skip mechanism in new projects and ensure purely decorative icons are hidden from AT.

## 2026-01-02 - Built-in Loading States
**Learning:** Adding `isLoading` prop directly to the base `Button` component simplifies the implementation of feedback states across the app and ensures consistent spinner usage (same icon, animation, and placement).
**Action:** When auditing UI components, look for repetitive patterns like conditional spinner rendering and move them into the core component.

## 2026-01-02 - Radix Slot & React.Children.only
**Learning:** When using Radix UI `Slot` (via `asChild`), the component must return exactly one React element. Conditional rendering that returns `null` or `false` alongside children (e.g. `{false} {children}`) creates an array, causing a runtime error.
**Action:** Guard conditional rendering in `asChild` components to ensure only the child is passed to `Slot`, or avoid injecting extra elements when `asChild` is true.
