## 2026-01-02 - Accessible Skip Link & Decorative SVGs
**Learning:** Added a skip-to-content link, a critical yet often overlooked a11y feature. It is hidden until focused, respecting the design while empowering keyboard users. Also marked purely decorative SVGs with `aria-hidden="true"` to reduce screen reader noise.
**Action:** Always check for a main content skip mechanism in new projects and ensure purely decorative icons are hidden from AT.
